according to our t-test, the observed difference in the proportion
of positive reviews between the group that mentions the gameplay element and
the group that doesn’t isn’t large enough to rule out the possibility that it
occurred just by random chance. In other words, we don't have strong statistical
evidence to say that the presence or absence of that gameplay element has a real
effect on whether reviews are positive

## **3. Instructions for Reproducing Results**  

### **üìù 1. Gameplay Element Extraction (Python)**
1. **Load the dataset** (`steam_reviews_english.csv` or `steam_reviews_with_gameplay_elements.csv`).
2. **Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Python** to extract gameplay-related terms such as "combat", "graphics", "story", etc.
3. **Filter out irrelevant terms** and categorize them under predefined gameplay elements.
4. **Save the updated dataset** as `steam_reviews_with_gameplay_elements.csv`.

### **üìä 2. Sentiment Analysis (R)**
1. **Load the English-language Steam review dataset** into R. Take a random sample of **10,000** observations. Alternatively, use the pre-sampled dataset in the `DATA` folder.
2. **Convert the review text to a character vector**, clean the data by removing punctuation, numbers, and HTML formatting, and make all characters lowercase.
3. **Use the `syuzhet` package** to obtain sentiment scores using the NRC method. This will return sentiment values where positive numbers indicate positive sentiment and negative numbers indicate negative sentiment.
4. **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using `ggplot2` to visualize sentiment distribution.
5. **Perform a t-test**:
   - Split the dataset into **recommended** and **not recommended** reviews.
   - Run **t-tests** to determine if **recommended** reviews have a significantly positive sentiment and **not recommended** reviews have a significantly negative sentiment.
6. **Save the results** as `sentiment_analysis_results.csv`.

### **üìà 3. Merging Sentiment Scores with Gameplay Elements (Python)**
1. **Load both `steam_reviews_with_gameplay_elements.csv` and `sentiment_analysis_results.csv`** into Python.
2. **Merge datasets on `review_id`**, ensuring that sentiment scores align with the correct reviews.
3. **Save the final dataset** as `final_steam_reviews.csv`.

### **üé® 4. Visualizations (Python)**
1. **Generate sentiment distribution histograms** to check the balance between positive and negative reviews.
2. **Create bar charts of the most frequently mentioned gameplay elements**.
3. **Visualize sentiment scores by gameplay element** using box plots.
4. **Compare recommendation rates by gameplay element** using bar charts.
5. **Save all figures in the `OUTPUT` folder**.

### **üìä 5. Statistical Analysis - T-Tests (Python)**
1. **Run one-sample t-tests** to test whether the mean sentiment score for reviews mentioning each gameplay element differs significantly from **neutral (0)**.
2. **Run two-sample t-tests**:
   - Compare **sentiment scores** for reviews mentioning a specific gameplay element vs. those that don‚Äôt.
   - Compare **positive review rates** (proportion of reviews with sentiment > 0) between these two groups.
3. **Interpret the results**:
   - If p < 0.05, the presence of the gameplay element has a **statistically significant** impact on review sentiment.
   - If p > 0.05, the element **does not significantly** affect sentiment.
4. **Print and save statistical results**.

## **5. Summary**
This project examines how different **gameplay elements impact review sentiment** on Steam. By combining **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** with **sentiment analysis** and **statistical hypothesis testing**, we:
- Extracted **gameplay elements** from reviews.  
-  Measured **sentiment scores** using `syuzhet` in R.  
-  Performed **t-tests** to analyze whether gameplay elements correlate with positive or negative reviews.  
-  Created **data visualizations** to display relationships.  

Our results highlight which game elements contribute most to **positive or negative reviews** and provide **data-driven insights** into player preferences.
